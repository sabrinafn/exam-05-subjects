### Set ###

Uniqueness: Sets only contain distinct elements. 
Order: The order of elements in a set is not significant. 
Example: The set {a, b} is the same as the set {b, a}. 


### Bags (Multisets) ###

Duplicates Allowed: Bags allow elements to appear multiple times. 
Order: Like sets, order is not significant in a bag. 
Multiplicity: Each element in a bag has a multiplicity, indicating how many times it appears. 
Example: The bag {a, a, b, b, b, c} has a = 2, b = 3, and c = 1.
