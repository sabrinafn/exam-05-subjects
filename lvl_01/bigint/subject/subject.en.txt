In computer science, a bignum is an object representing an arbitrary precision number.
This is useful when you want to store a number bigger than SIZE_MAX without any loss of precision.
This is often achieve by string the member as an array or a string containing the digits.

Create a class called bigint that will store an arbitrary precision unsigned integer.
Your class must support addition, comparison, and a digitshift, similar to the bitshift,
but instead of shifting the bits, you will shift the digits in base 10,  e.g. (42 << 3 == 42000)
and (1337 >> 2 == 13).
Your bigint must be printable with the << operator (in base 10), and the output should not
contain any leading zeros.
You will find a main in this directory that must work with your class.
