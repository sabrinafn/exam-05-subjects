Here's how wikipedia define sets and bags.

    In computer science, a set is an abstract class data type that
can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer
implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most
other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from
a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.

    A generalization of the notion of a set is that of a multiset or bag,
which is similar to a set but allow, repeated ("equal") values (duplicates).
This is used in two distinct senses: either equal values are considered
identical, and are simply counted, or equal values are considered equivalent,
and are stored as distinct items.
