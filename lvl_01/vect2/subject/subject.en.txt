Assignment name : vect2
Expected files  : vect2.cpp vect2.hpp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Create a class vect2 representing a mathematical vector
of dimension 2 containing elements of type 'int'.

- It must support addition, subtraction, and multiplication
by a scalar (such as the expression 
(vec2(2, 2) * 2 == vect2(4, 4)) is true).

- The operator [] can be used to access the components of
your vector (using indices 0 and 1), no bound cheking is required.
Your object must be printable with the << operator, such that:
    std::cout << v << std::endl;
produces the same output as:
    s << "{" << v[0] << ", " << v[1] << "}" << std::endl;
    
You will find a main in this directory that must work with your class.
